# Project Title
 VSD Traffic Light Controller with Pedestrian Button

 ## Theme
The theme chosen is **FSM with Control Logic System**.

This theme is significant for modern urban infrastructure, as it addresses real-world challenges in traffic flow optimization and pedestrian safety using advanced digital hardware and programmable logic.
## Brief Introduction
A Traffic Light Controller with Pedestrian Button is an intelligent traffic management system designed to control the flow of vehicles and pedestrians at road intersections. Unlike basic traffic lights, this system includes a push-button for pedestrians. When pressed, the button signals the controller to safely halt vehicle traffic and allow pedestrians to cross. This ensures both efficient vehicle movement and enhanced pedestrian safety, making it a crucial feature in urban and suburban traffic systems.
## Expected Output
### 1.Normal Operation
--> The traffic lights cycle through green, yellow, and red phases for vehicles.

--> The pedestrian signal remains in "Donâ€™t Walk" (red).
### 2.Pedestrain Request
--> When the pedestrian button is pressed, the controller detects the request.
### 3.Crossing Phase
--> Vehicles are stopped (red light).
### 4.Safety and Efficiency
--> Making sure only on crossing is allowed per button press.
